Some of the files in this are purposefully screwed up, so that we can fix the app as we go along.

Walk through what the app should do.
- Index has a placeholder. On init, the app should make copies of the elements we'll need, and then remove the placeholder.
- When we search for a pokemon, we want the template to be updated with our pokemon's info, and the page to update accordingly.

Start the demonstration by loading the app. We'll see a 404 for our image. This is because our image is at the wrong location.
Change the styles sheet to have the right url.

Reload the page.
The app won't work because Typename is not defined.
Typename is not defined because we forgot to include it as a script tag.

We are not getting any useful data back from the server if we capitalize our pokemon's name, even though we are sending a 200 status.
This is because the promise technically resolves, but the pokemon is not found because it needs to be in all lower case.
To fix this, coerce the pokemon's name to be in all lower case on the server.
Add console statements so we can track what's happening.

Now, we should be getting data back from the server. However, it is not showing up correctly.
The main view appends itself to the #mainbar, which causes it to show up below the first row.
Can fix this by changing ln 56 of js/pokemain to: $('#mainbar').find('.box').append($pokemain);

Our stats are not rendering correctly. This is because the stats object has a stats property that we're not accoutning for.
To fix this, change line 16 of js/pokestats to look up stats.stats.

No need to fix this because CSS, but the display will look bad in phone view.
